    "Assign 8 (Lab 4): Transfer Learning with a CNN\n",
    "======================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has been adapted from the [PyTorch tutorial on transfer learning](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html).\n",
    "Similar to the original tutorial, this one will demonstrate two different variations of transfer learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in class, __[transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning)__ in machine learning is about utilizing an already-trained model for your specific problem or use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large neural networks can take a significant amount of resources to train, in terms of long training time,\n",
    "massive dataset size, and costly computer hardware. Given that, it's\n",
    "no surprise that we would want to avoid training a model from scratch. This is where transfer learning comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning starts by taking a pre-trained neural network model that was trained to, say, predict which of\n",
    "1000 possible types of animals is in an image. This model is then used/repurposed/recycled to, say, predict which of two animals\n",
    "is in an image. Note that two types of animals that you want to perform classification on don't even need to be part of the original 1000 animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of transfer learning techniques we'll try. Technically, we will be using the exact same model architecture with the pre-trained parameters, but they will be different instances of the model. We will refer to them as Approach A and Approach B. The differences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Approach A: Finetuning the ConvNet** - Start with the pre-trained model, change the final output layer to have only 2 units (or neurons), and then fine-tune or refit the model on our Ant and Bee images. All the parameter values can change. \n",
    "-   **Approach B: ConvNet as fixed feature extractor** - Again, start with the pre-trained model, change the final output layer to have only 2 units (or neurons), but this time only allow the parameter values in the (new) final layer to be modified.\n",
